# NewsBirdServer

This is the source code of the server component of the NewsBird project. You can find the source code of the visualization at https://github.com/fhamborg/NewsBirdHtml.
Please note that we are currently preparing both repositories, which mainly will include
* add a documentation how to setup the tool
* remove code that is not required any longer in the final version of NewsBird

If you have any question until then, just send an email to felix.hamborg@uni-konstanz.de.
