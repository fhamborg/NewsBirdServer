"cnn-0b1fa204ad42a3d4c2f1df7e843d101b","(cnn) -- mystery surrounds a shooting incident on a country road in eastern ukraine that left several people dead and ratcheted up tensions in the region, where pro-russian groups have seized government buildings and set up roadblocks in defiance of authorities in the ukrainian capital, kiev. in the early hours of sunday morning, according to pro-russian groups in the town of slaviansk, one of their roadblocks to the west of the town came under attack. they say three or four vehicles approached the roadblock, and their occupants opened fire on the barricades' defenders. pro-russian protesters at the roadblock told cnn on sunday that as the attack got under way, they called for support, and armed men arrived to engage the attackers. two burned-out cars were still at the scene sunday afternoon, one of them riddled with bullet holes on one side. the sides gave conflicting reports on the casualties. local pro-russian officials say three defenders at the barricades were killed, as well as two of the attackers.  a statement on the interior ministry's website said that four cars with unknown occupants approached a checkpoint at the entrance to the city and opened fire on people manning it, and shots were returned. three people were killed and three were wounded, that statement said. two of the wounded received medical care but refused to be sent to the hospital. there were about a dozen people in two cars that drove away from the scene in the direction of the kharkiv region, according to the statement, and the two remaining cars at the scene were set on fire and destroyed. cnn has been unable to confirm the number of dead. efforts to contact the hospital in slaviansk were unsuccessful. but pro-russian leaders in slaviansk displayed a body briefly outside the state security building in the town, which they have occupied for a week. they said the body was one of the alleged assailants. along with the body, they displayed what they claimed were an identity tag and card as evidence that the attack was carried out by the ultranationalist ukrainian right sector, along with substantial amounts of u.s. cash and ammunition. the right sector immediately denied any of its members were in the area. the information that one of our members was shot in slaviansk is false, said borislav bereza, head of the information department for right sector. we don't have id cards with numbers. we only have id cards with letters, where we mention the department where the person works, said bereza. cnn called the number on the calling card and reached a woman who seemed to be surprised she had been called. she said that she was in kiev and had no relation to anyone in right sector. the ukrainian state security service, the sbu, said in a statement that armed offenders and saboteurs who are terrorizing the local population in slaviansk had resorted to cynical provocation. it said one person had died in the incident. in the hours after the attack, the self-declared mayor of slaviansk, vyacheslav ponomarev, called for a russian peacekeeping force to protect against the national guard and the right sector. the local leadership of the pro-russian armed militants and protesters who hold several buildings in and around slaviansk has declared a midnight to 6 a.m. curfew in the wake of the shooting. the shooting is the second deadly incident in the last four days in eastern ukraine. on wednesday night, three people were killed during a demonstration outside a ukrainian military base in the southern city of mariupol. they appear to have been shot dead by ukrainian soldiers after attempting to break into the base and throwing molotov cocktails over its walls. the two sides in the crisis invariably give very different accounts of incidents of violence. pro-russian groups see the hand of fascists from kiev in many of the incidents, while ukrainian officials insist that russian special forces have been sent to ukraine to stir up trouble. as the occupation of buildings continued in about a dozen towns and cities across eastern ukraine, interior minister arsen avakov announced on his facebook page that he was traveling to eastern ukraine to inspect the readiness of troops. international monitors from the organization for security and co-operation in europe continue to visit many of the affected towns, but have had no success so far in persuading groups that have taken over buildings to relinquish them. the osce presence was mandated by an agreement among russia, the united states and the european union last week to try to negotiate the handover of the buildings. in three towns, pro-russian protesters and militants have made it clear to cnn they have no intention of moving until the illegal government in kiev also moves out of official buildings. putin's 'final destination' on sunday, ukrainian prime minister arseniy yatsenyuk appeared on nbc's meet the press. (russian) president (vladimir) putin has a dream to restore the soviet union, he said. and every day, he goes further and further. and god knows where is the final destination. the world has a reason to be concerned about putin's intention, yatsenyuk said. because what russian federation did, they undermined the global stability. the united states is trying diplomatic measures to reduce tensions in ukraine. geoffrey pyatt, the u.s. ambassador to ukraine, told cnn's candy crowley on sunday that he's seen progress to that end. he had just met with ukrainian foreign minister andriy deshchytsia and the ambassador who heads the osce's special monitoring mission, along with his european union and russian counterparts. i think we all reaffirmed today in this setting our collective commitment to trying to make the geneva framework a success, he said on cnn's state of the union. there are obviously some real challenges at this point, including the violence in slaviansk. but we also believe that there has been some progress. i'm seeing reports this morning that at least one of these (occupied) government buildings now has a ukrainian flag flying over it, he said. and the osce has monitors on the ground who are reaching out, engaging with local political elites, seeing if there's a way to de-escalate the crisis. there is no military solution to the crisis, pyatt said. it has to be solved through diplomacy."
"ibtimes-au-ffa8bc8c3af001c9e39431a4a42b4871","and the united states signed off on the agreement in geneva on thursday designed to lower tension in the worst confrontation between russia and the west since the cold war. the agreement calls for occupied buildings to be vacated under the auspices of envoys from the organization for security and cooperation in europe. but no sooner had the accord been signed than both sides accused the other of breaking it, while the pro-moscow rebels disavowed the pledge to withdraw from occupied buildings. an osce mediator, mark etherington, held his first meeting with the leader of separatists in slaviansk, a town which rebels have turned into a heavily-fortified redoubt. etherington said he had asked the pro-russian self-proclaimed people's mayor of the town, vyacheslav ponomaryov, whether he would comply with the geneva agreement, but gave no hint about the response. ponomaryov later told a news conference: we did not negotiate, we talked. we told them our position, what happened here, and they told us about their plans. etherington said he had also asked about people being held in slaviansk, including the woman who was serving as mayor until the uprising. her fate has not been made clear. in other signs the geneva accord was far from being implemented, activists in slaviansk brought up trucks laden with sand and were filling sandbags to reinforce their barricades. in nearby kramatorsk, local media showed masked gunmen taking over the office of the sbu security service in the town, and leading away a civilian identified as the local police chief. separatists told reuters they would not disarm until right sector, a ukrainian nationalist group based in western ukraine, did so first. who should surrender weapons first? let us see right sector disarm first, let them make the first step and we will follow, said yevgeny gordik, a member of a separatist militia. we need dialogue. this is not dialogue. it is monologue. russia says right sector members have threatened russian speakers. kiev and western countries say the threat is largely invented by russian state-run media to justify moscow's intervention and cause alarm in russian speaking areas. moscow blames right sector for a shooting on easter sunday morning, when at least three people were killed at a checkpoint manned by armed separatists. right sector denies involvement, while kiev said russia provoked the violence. u.s. secretary of state john kerry urged his russian counterpart sergei lavrov on monday to help implement the geneva deal, including by publicly calling on separatists to vacate illegal buildings and checkpoints, spokeswoman jen psaki said. in its account of their telephone conversation, the russian foreign ministry said lavrov had called on kerry to influence kiev, not let hotheads there provoke a bloody conflict and to encourage it to fulfil its obligations unflaggingly. one european diplomat said the deal was a way for russian president vladimir putin to buy time and undermine momentum towards tougher sanctions: talks and compromises are just part of his tactics, said the diplomat. he wants to have ukraine. soldiers freed. the slaviansk separatists released around a dozen ukrainian soldiers in blue uniforms on monday, without making clear the circumstances under which they had been held. gordik said armoured vehicles that were surrendered by a column of ukrainian paratroops last week would stay in the town. putin announced last month that moscow has the right to intervene in its neighbours to protect russian speakers. he then annexed ukraine's crimea peninsula. moscow has since massed tens of thousands of troops on the ukrainian border, and kiev and its western allies say russian agents are directing the uprising in the east, including the green men - heavily armed, masked gunmen in unmarked uniforms. in his latest move, likely to be seen by the west as a further threat to the post-cold war order, putin signed a law on monday making it easier for russian speakers across the former soviet union to obtain russian citizenship. [id:nl6n0nd0wh] eastern ukraine is largely russian-speaking and many residents are suspicious of the pro-european government that took power in kiev in february when moscow-backed president viktor yanukovich fled the country after mass protests. separatists have declared an independent people's republic of donetsk in the east's biggest province and have named themselves to official posts in towns and cities, setting up checkpoints and flying russian flags over government buildings. there is also some support for ukrainian unity in the region, but pro-kiev activists have had a lower profile since the separatists took up arms. one activist who helped organise a unity rally in rubizhne, a town in the eastern luhansk region, told ukraine's channel 5 television that separatists attacked it, forcing the rally to disperse. local police said a policeman was hurt when unidentified people tried to disrupt the rally. in the regional capital luhansk, interfax-ukraine news agency said a meeting of about 3,000 people in the local sbu headquarters had elected a people's governor and voted to hold a two-stage referendum next month on union with russia. ukraine announced an operation to retake rebel-held territory earlier this month, but that modest effort largely collapsed in disarray. kiev has declared an easter truce, though it is far from clear it could muster any real force if it tried. the army is ill-equipped, untested and untrained for domestic operations, while the government in kiev doubts the loyalty of the police. the united states and eu have imposed visa bans and asset freezes on some russians over the annexation of crimea, measures explicitly designed not to have wider economic impact and which have been mocked as pointless by moscow. washington and brussels both say they are working on tougher measures they will impose unless russia's allies in eastern ukraine back down, although building a consensus is tricky in europe where many countries rely on russian energy exports. the osce, a european security body that includes both nato members and russia, has so far deployed around 100 monitors and mediators in ukraine and expects their number to rise. an osce spokesman said the mediators were visiting separatist-occupied buildings with copies of last week's geneva accord to explain it to the people inside. it's a mixed experience dealing with checkpoints and so forth and there is a varying reaction to teams. there is a hardened attitude in donetsk or slaviansk but some other areas are more accommodating, spokesman michael bociurkiw said. when teams go to smaller centres people are more willing to talk."
"post-gazette-075b4e290b7967ff66c2ff97ce9628da","slovyansk, ukraine -- russia on thursday began military drills on its border with ukraine as the government there mobilized against pro-russian militants, killing as many as five people, according to ukrainian officials. russian president vladimir putin condemned the ukrainian actions, and his top deputies said a ukrainian mobilization in the restive eastern part of the country would draw a russian response. the tit-for-tat military movements brought the two sides closer to a direct armed confrontation in a standoff that analysts call one of the most dangerous on european soil since the end of the cold war. if the kiev regime has started to use the army against the population inside the country, it beyond any doubt is a very serious crime, mr. putin said at a media forum in st. petersburg. he added that if ukrainian authorities escalated the confrontation, there would be consequences. after a day of increasingly dire reports from the ground, the obama administration struck back, at least verbally. if russia continues in this direction, it will not just be a grave mistake, it will be an expensive mistake, secretary of state john kerry said in washington. although he announced no new sanctions, mr. kerry said the window [for russia] to change course is closing. .... we are ready to act. the pro-russian activists were killed in fighting at three checkpoints surrounding the city of slovyansk, and one ukrainian soldier was wounded, the ukrainian interior ministry said in a statement. the violence broke out as security forces attempted to dislodge protesters and pro-russian militants who have encamped in cities across eastern ukraine, with other fighting reported at an arms depot and a city hall. the russian military launched the tactical drills in the regions bordering ukraine in response to the events, russian defense minister sergei shoigu said at a meeting in moscow. if ukraine's war machine does not halt, it will lead to a large number of casualties, he said. we have to react to such a development. the russian defense minister said the drills would include aerial exercises near the border. the leading candidate in ukraine's upcoming presidential election, former foreign minister petro poroshenko, said three russian military helicopters crossed the border and entered ukrainian airspace. he said the incident was being investigated. ukraine wants russia to stop the constant threats and blackmail and to withdraw its troops from the border, ukraine's acting president, oleksandr turchynov, said thursday. a senior u.s. official said the united states is aware of reports of helicopter incursions into ukrainian airspace but could not confirm them. that said, we are watching russian troop movements on the border with great concern, the official said. any further russian military intervention into ukraine would be a grave mistake. mr. kerry held russia fully responsible for the escalating violence. this is a full-throated effort to actively sabotage the democratic process through gross external intimidation, he said. u.s. intelligence has reported that russian intelligence and special operations forces are playing an active role in eastern ukraine. nobody should doubt russia's hand in it, including with personnel, weapons, money and coordination of separatist actions, mr. kerry said. fully supporting charges levied by the ukraine government, mr. kerry cited intercepted communications between known russian agents and separatists in ukraine as well as extensive social media photographs of russian special operations members on the ground. noting that it has been a full week since russia agreed in a geneva meeting with the united states, ukraine and europe to help avoid further escalation, mr. kerry said the accord mr. putin's government signed is not open to interpretation. it is not vague. it is not subjective. it is not optional. while the ukrainian government has kept its commitments to begin a process of constitutional reform and respect minority rights, russia has put its faith in distraction, deception and destabilization. ... [and] refused to take a single concrete step in the right direction, mr. kerry said. president barack obama said wednesday that a new round of sanctions against russian individuals had already been drawn up, and mr. kerry said previous measures have already damaged russia's first-quarter economy, including growth estimates revised downward by 2 to 3 percentage points and $70 billion in capital that has fled the russian financial system. in a tokyo news conference at the first stop on his asia trip, mr. obama said the united states has teed up additional sanctions that could be imposed against russia unless mr. putin does more to encourage pro-russian militants in eastern ukraine to disarm. there's always the possibility that tomorrow or the next day russia takes another course, he said. do i think they're going to do that? so far, the evidence doesn't make me hopeful."

(as a side note, levchin hates the term “secret sauce”… “i don’t like putting the veneer of magic over technology,” he says.) by understanding the loans that affirm approved and had paid off, the company can build on and improve a new model for consumer finance. that stands in contrast to the current credit card debt model, where financial institutions benefit the longer that consumers take to pay off a bill, and from each late payment. that will enable it to help consumers save money on their purchases as opposed to putting them on a credit card, and could also have benefits for repeat users. if you successfully pay off a split pay financing, for instance, you’ll be more likely to be approved for a larger amount or on more favorable terms a second time. “the goal is not to create revenue from people going into debt,” levchin said. a new way for merchants to get paid. affirm makes money both as a payment processor — taking a small portion of each sale — as well as from interest it collects from consumers. the company is also taking on all risk from loans that default, which means that merchants who sign up will get paid whether or not a consumer successfully paid back the loan. for a growing group of merchants, adding a new, risk-free way for consumers to finance purchases has a strong appeal. as a result, affirm has managed to sign up more than 100 e-commerce companies to test out the product. to support those early adopters, affirm is working closely with its initial partners to ensure things run smoothly. but there will come a time when the company hopes to provide a self-serve widget — kind of like paypal’s buy now button — that will allow merchants to deploy affirm as a payment option on their own. because it has a dual revenue model, and because the team believes it can do a better job of determining the risk of lending to consumers, affirm can likely produce better margins than typical loan processors. ultimately, that means it can pass on savings to consumers in the form of lower interest rates than competing financing options. ceo again. levchin said it wasn’t his intent to take over as ceo of affirm, but he missed running a company. in the four years since google acquired levchin’s social gaming company slide, he’s been mostly focused on building up his so-called “mad scientist lab / investment vehicle” hvf. but the opportunity at affirm was too big for him to be sitting on the sidelines. “i originally planned to be chairman, not ceo,” levchin told me. “but i realized would rather be an active member of the team than watch someone else run it.” as a lending company, levchin says several things matter as it scales up — you have to increase your book of loans, make sure lenders aren’t too highly concentrated, and get high approval and repayment rates, all while increasing the number of merchants that use the product. but those are all challenges levchin seems not only prepared for, but excited about.  overview affirm uses data to solve hard problems in finance. affirm builds financial products that deliver innovative online buying experiences to consumers and merchants. founders  overview hvf is an umbrella project for max levchin's data-focused undertakings. its core thesis is that thanks to low-cost sensors of every imaginable type, near-ubiquitous wireless broadband, advances in distributed computing and storage, data is becoming our most plentiful, and most under-exploited commodity. the insights mined from it will unlock enormous productivity gains, create efficiencies where none; website"

"npr-c1326faab410ee38a08fbca10c1f0e3a","russian president vladimir putin has asked his parliament to revoke his authorization to use force in ukraine. , the kremlin said the move was intended to to help normalize the situation and achieve reconciliation in the east of ukraine and in connection with the tri-partite negotiations on the issue that have begun recently. putin's request comes a day after a shaky ceasefire took effect in the east. the request, the paper adds, seems to signal that russia was trying to calm the situation as peace talks start between the ukrainian government and pro-russian separatists who have seized government buildings and cities in the country's east. this whole conflict started after violent protests ended in the ouster of pro-russian president viktor yanukovych. putin asked for parliament's permission to use force in ukraine in march and then seized upon the instability by annexing crimea. since then, the government in kiev, and some of its international partners — including the u.s. — have worried that russia is poised for further incursion into ukrainian territory. in fact, it was just a day ago that european foreign ministers were threatening russia with further sanctions if it did not deescalate the situation in ukraine. npr's corey flintoff tells our newscast unit that now that the ceasefire is in effect, russia seems to be distancing itself from pro-russian separatists in ukraine. parliament is controlled by putin loyalists, and a senior lawmaker says the authority will be revoked tomorrow, corey reports. russian stocks and the ruble both rose on the prospects that russia might avoid economic sanctions."

"wbur-d745e46fb378e84f0d2e26308b5a68b3","washington the supreme court ruled wednesday that a startup internet company has to pay broadcasters when it takes television programs from the airwaves and allows subscribers to watch them on smartphones and other portable devices. the justices said by a 6-3 vote that aereo inc. is violating the broadcasters’ copyrights by taking the signals for free. the ruling preserves the ability of the television networks to collect huge fees from cable and satellite systems that transmit their programming. aereo is available in new york, boston, houston and atlanta among 11 metropolitan areas and uses thousands of dime-size antennas to capture television signals and transmit them to subscribers who pay as little as $8 a month for the service. company executives have said their business model would not survive a loss at the supreme court. some justices worried during arguments in april that a ruling for the broadcasters could also harm the burgeoning world of cloud computing, which gives users access to a vast online computer network that stores and processes information. but justice stephen breyer in his majority opinion that the court did not intend to call cloud computing into question. but breyer also said aereo should be treated no different from a cable system. “aereo’s system is, for all practical purposes, identical to a cable system,” he said. justices antonin scalia, samuel alito and clarence thomas dissented. scalia said he shares the majority’s feeling that what aereo is doing “ought not to be allowed.” but he said the court has distorted federal copyright law to forbid it. congress should decide whether the law “needs an upgrade,” scalia said. broadcasters including abc, cbs, fox, nbc and pbs sued aereo for copyright infringement, saying aereo should pay for redistributing the programming in the same way cable and satellite systems must or risk high-profile blackouts of channels that anger their subscribers. in each market, aereo has a data center with thousands of dime-size antennas. when a subscriber wants to watch a show live or record it, the company temporarily assigns the customer an antenna and transmits the program over the internet to the subscriber’s laptop, tablet, smartphone or even a big-screen tv with a roku or apple tv streaming device. the antenna is only used by one subscriber at a time, and aereo says that’s much like the situation at home, where a viewer uses a personal antenna to watch over-the-air broadcasts for free. the broadcasters and professional sports leagues also feared that nothing in the case would limit aereo to local service. major league baseball and the national football league have lucrative contracts with the television networks and closely guard the airing of their games. aereo’s model would pose a threat if, say, a consumer in new york could watch nfl games from anywhere through his aereo subscription. the federal appeals court in new york ruled that aereo did not violate the copyrights of broadcasters with its service, but a similar service has been blocked by judges in los angeles and washington, d.c. the 2nd u.s. circuit court of appeals said its ruling stemmed from a 2008 decision in which it held that cablevision systems corp. could offer a remote digital video recording service without paying additional licensing fees to broadcasters because each playback transmission was made to a single subscriber using a single unique copy produced by that subscriber. the supreme court declined to hear the appeal from movie studios, tv networks and cable tv channels. in the aereo case, a dissenting judge said his court’s decision would eviscerate copyright law. judge denny chin called aereo’s setup a sham and said the individual antennas are a “rube goldberg-like contrivance” – an overly complicated device that accomplishes a simple task in a confusing way – that exists for the sole purpose of evading copyright law. smaller cable companies, independent broadcasters and consumer groups backed aereo, warning the court not to try to predict the future of television. indeed, scalia himself noted that the high court came within a vote of declaring videocassette recorders “contraband” when it ruled for sony corp. in a case over recordings of television programs 30 years ago."

"denverpost-12af4bab3bc48560a812e52e2b03d2f4","brussels (ap) ukrainian president petro poroshenko on friday signed up to a trade and economic pact with the european union, saying it may be the most important day for his country since it became independent from the soviet union. it was the decision of his pro-moscow predecessor, viktor yanukovych, to back out of the same eu association agreement in november that touched off massive protests in ukraine that eventually led to yanukovych's flight abroad, russia's annexation of the crimean peninsula and the ongoing tensions between russia and ukraine. later friday, eu heads of state and government were expected to consider whether to ramp up sanctions against russia over its conduct toward ukraine. before the signing ceremony, poroshenko brandished a commemorative pen inscribed with the date of eu's vilnius summit where yanukovych balked at approving the agreement. historic events are unavoidable, he said. at friday's proceedings, the european union signed similar association agreements with two other former soviet republics, moldova and georgia. businesses in the three countries whose goods and practices meet eu standards will be able to trade freely in any of the eu's 28 member nations without tariffs or restrictions. likewise, eu goods and services will be able to sell more easily and cheaply to businesses and consumers in ukraine, georgia and moldova. it's absolutely a new perspective for my country, poroshenko said. there is nothing in these agreements or in the european union's approach that might harm russia in any way, insisted eu president herman van rompuy. but almost immediately, moscow made clear it was reserving the right to react. dmitry peskov, a spokesman for president vladimir putin, told russian news agencies that the kremlin would respond to the eu-ukraine accord as soon as negative consequences arise for the economy. but peskov dismissed the threat of immediate action against poroshenko's government. in order for those (consequences) to arise, the signed agreement needs to be implemented, he said. russia has previously imposed trade embargos against its neighbors in response to political or economic moves that the kremlin views as unfavorable. european commission experts estimate implementation of the deal is expected to boost ukraine's national income by around 1.2 billion euros ($1.6 billion) a year. eu enlargement commission stefan fule said the trade bloc has made clear to moscow its willingness to demonstrate that russian economic interests will not be harmed. perhaps more important than the trade clauses is an accompanying 10-year plan for ukraine to adopt eu product regulations. such rules ease the way for international trade beyond europe. the deal also demands that ukraine change the way it does business. adopting eu rules on government contracts, competition policy and the copyright for ideas and inventions should improve the economy by making it more investor-friendly and reducing corruption. reminding eu leaders of the ukrainians who died opposed yanukovych's government and in the ongoing battle against the pro-russian insurgency in the country's east, poroshenko said ukraine paid the highest possible price to make her europe dreams come true. he asked eu leaders to take a further step, and formally pledge that one day ukraine will be able to join the eu as a full-fledged member. that would cost the european union nothing, but would mean the world to my country, he said. ap correspondents laura mills in moscow and david mchugh in kiev contributed."

the coffin will lie in state in the holy trinity cathedral. below is a round-up of some of the statements and condolences of current and former officials and leaders over death of shevardnadze: russia’s president vladimir putin said in his message of condolence addressed to shevardnadze’s family: “eduard amvrosiyevich [shevardnadze] lived a life full of dramatic events. he played an important role in sharp turns of development of the soviet union and his native georgia. his memory as of a great politician and statesman will live on in hearts of many people in our countries.” former soviet president mikhail gorbachev “eduard shevardnadze was an extraordinary, talented person he made a serious contribution in foreign policy of perestroika; he was a sincere supporter of new way of thinking in the world affairs. his appointment as the [soviet union’s] foreign minister was a surprise for many, but he was skillful on this post, winning appreciation from diplomats, friends and workmates, foreign partners. he played a huge role in the unification of germany and in the european affairs in general, in normalization of relations with china, in dialogue with the united states. i would like to especially note his contribution in stopping nuclear arms race.” foreign minister of germany frank-walter steinmeier said in a “as foreign minister of the soviet union and later as president of georgia, eduard shevardnadze had a major impact on our continent’s history. with his death, the world has lost a person who demonstrated courage and vision in times of great historic changes. his role in overcoming the cold war and the division of europe shall not be forgotten. german reunification would not have been possible without his resolve and commitment.” hans-dietrich genscher, shevardnadze’s west german counterpart in the late 1980s, told the associated press: “i think one can say that he was one of the significant and outstanding statesmen of the 20th century,” u.s. secretary of state john kerry said in a “as foreign minister of the soviet union in the 1980s, shevardnadze played an instrumental role with president gorbachev, president reagan, and secretary shultz in bringing the cold war to an end. he reduced the risk of nuclear confrontation by giving new life to arms control negotiations. he opposed the hardliners and refused to use force against central and eastern european countries when they began political and economic reforms, and he advocated reform within the soviet union as well. as georgia's second president following the restoration of independence, shevardnadze helped ensure the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that fragile state during the 1990s, and put georgia on its irreversible trajectory toward euro-atlantic integration. as georgia pauses to reflect on the life of one of its great statesmen, we urge all georgians to remain committed to a united, democratic georgia.” former u.s. secretary of state james baker said: “eduard shevardnadze will have an honored place in history because he and mikhail gorbachev refused to support the use of force to keep the soviet empire together.” belarus president alexander lukashenko said in a condolences message addressed to georgian president margvelashvili, the people of georgia, and the family and friends of shevardnadze: “the huge authority of eduard shevardnadze on the international arena, his unique personal qualities and extensive experience of being directly involved the soviet state building helped to develop and strengthen the independent georgian state, made a big contribution to the enhancement of relations between the republic of belarus and georgia.” president of azerbaijan ilham aliyev sent two separate condolence messages to the shevardnadze family and another one to president of georgia giorgi margvelashvili; the latter one reads: eduard shevardnadze was an “outstanding georgian politician and statesman, a big friend of azerbaijan. the entire life, high state activities of eduard shevardnadze for the prosperity of brotherly georgia earned him authority, deep respect and worldwide recognition. eduard shevardnadze made a tremendous contribution to the preservation, development and strengthening of centuries-long traditions of friendship, good neighborliness and mutual support between the peoples of azerbaijan and georgia. national leader heydar aliyev and eduard shevardnadze are the founding fathers and those who developed qualitatively the new intergovernmental relations and strategic partnership between our brotherly nations.” foreign minister of sweden carl bildt on his twitter: wrote “eduard shevardnadze was a big personality of our time. his december 1990 resignation should not be forgotten today.” javier solana, former nato secretary general and ex-chief of eu foreign policy, on his twitter “sad. great friend. key at end urrs and reunification of germany. great figure.”"

"ibtimes-uk-1d7b1f733f2ab77286cf1353f1e62ef8","a mind-wandering programme capable of detecting involuntary lapses in concentration has been developed by scientists in the us. the ubiquitous phenomenon of mind-wandering - or zoning out - is attributed to having negative effects on people's ability to learn and was estimated by scientists from the university of notre dame and the university of memphis to occur 20% to 50% of the time with subjects in their tests.  in an effort to better understand this phenomenon and create an intervention method that could prevent it, the researchers created a way of detecting mind-wandering. the study, titled toward fully automated person-independent detection of mind wandering , was presented at the user modeling, adaptation, and personalisation (umap) conference in aalborg, denmark. our lab (emotive computing lab) has been studying ways to automatically detect and respond to students' cognitive and affective states like confusion, frustration, and boredom for almost a decade, sidney d'mello, assistant professor in the department of computer science at the university of notre dame and lead author of the study, told ibtimes uk . in this research, we decided to focus on detecting mind wandering. the mind-wandering detection system works by using an eye tracker to monitor a subject's eye gaze patterns, both when concentrating and when loss of concentration is detected. machine learning methods then use this data to establish which gaze patterns in individuals signify that they are mind-wandering. combining the eye tracker with the machine learning technique allowed researchers to predict mind wandering with an accuracy of 72%. now that we can detect it with some accuracy, the next step is to trigger interventions aimed to dynamically restore attention when mind wandering occurs, d'mello said.  for example, the system can briefly highlight content missed due to mind wandering, trigger attentional reorienting messages, ask a quiz question and so on - there are many possible interventions that we are exploring. d'mello believes that the software could have major implications for high stakes tasks, such as those within military or aviation contexts. plans to develop this technology commercially are currently in the works, with discussions with the university of notre dame's technology transfer office ongoing."

"BangkokPost-1ef1443e80789e301768341028084a86","us president barack obama insisted that moscow force pro-russian insurgents controlling parts of east ukraine to cooperate with an international probe into the disaster, and said chaos at the impact site was an insult to families of the victims. with global fury mounting over the limited access given to investigators in the aftermath of the crash, the insurgents blamed for hampering the probe struck a breakthrough deal with malaysia to hand over two black boxes recovered from the plane wreckage. moscow, which has drawn ire for failing to rein in the pro-russian rebels, meanwhile hit back at us accusations that it supplied the weapons allegedly used to shoot down the airliner. on the ground, the animosity between ukraine's warring sides was underlined by intense shelling which erupted in the rebel stronghold of donetsk, a city just 60 kilometres (about 40 miles) from the station where the bodies had been held in refrigerated wagons. five people were killed and 12 wounded, as ukraine president petro poroshenko said he was ordering his troops to hold fire within a 40-kilometre radius around the crash site, where forensic experts were heading. obama put the responsibility to set the situation straight squarely on russia which has direct influence over these separatists. russian president vladimir putin must prove that he supports a full and fair investigation, obama said, stressing the burden now is on russia to insist that the separatists stop tampering with evidence, grant investigators who are already on the ground immediate, full, and unimpeded access to the crash site. - russian riposte - putin had appeared to adopt a conciliatory tone sunday, saying moscow would do everything in its power to resolve the three-month-old ukrainian conflict. but on monday, moscow moved to slap down us accusations that the missile system used to shoot down the aircraft was transferred from russia to separatists. a senior russian defence ministry official insisted that russia did not give the rebels buk missile systems or any other kinds of weapons or military hardware. moscow challenged kiev instead, saying records showed a ukrainian military plane was flying just three to five kilometres from the boeing 777 before it crashed on thursday, killing all 298 people on board. with what aim was a military plane flying along a civilian aviation route practically at the same time and at the same flight level as a passenger liner? asked lieutenant-general andrei kartopolov. ukraine's president petro poroshenko swiftly dismissed that claim, calling it an irresponsible and false statement by russia. russia's riposte came after kiev released fresh recordings of what it says are intercepted conversations between rebels conspiring to hide the flight's black boxes from international monitors. and the us embassy confirmed as authentic recordings released earlier by kiev of an intercepted call between an insurgent commander and a russian intelligence officer as they realised they had shot down a passenger jet. the washington post said ukraine's counterintelligence chief had photographs and other evidence that three buk m-1 anti-aircraft missile systems moved from rebel-held territory into russia less than 12 hours after the crash. and poroshenko said the rebels were wasting their time as it is simply impossible to remove and destroy all the evidence because the shrapnel is dispersed in the area of 20 square kilometres. - crash site chaos 'insult' - earlier at the torez railway station, dutch investigators wearing masks and headlights were finally allowed to examine the remains of over 200 recovered bodies. as they opened each of the train wagons holding the remains, an overpowering stench filled the air. patience was wearing thin over the limited access to the crash site in grabove, but malaysia's premier said late monday rebels have now agreed to give investigators freedom to examine the scene. najib added that six members of his team would accompany the train carrying the victims' remains to the government-held east ukrainian city of kharkiv where they would be handed over to the dutch, who have been asked by kiev to lead the probe. earlier monday, obama denounced the chaotic removal of bodies by rebels as an insult to those who have lost loved ones while australian prime minister tony abbott called it an absolutely shambolic situation. as grief turned to anger, the public prosecutor's office in the netherlands said it had opened a criminal probe into the downing of the plane, which had 193 dutch on board. the outrage was palpable in an open letter from dutch national hans de borst, who lost his 17-year-old daughter elsemiek. thank you very much mr putin, separatist leaders or the ukrainian government, for murdering my dear and only child, he wrote in the letter published by dutch media. i hope that you're proud to have destroyed her young life and that you can look yourself in the mirror. after meeting bereaved families, an emotional dutch king willem-alexander said the disaster has left a deep wound in our society. - fresh sanctions? - the un security council is expected to adopt an australia-backed resolution demanding pro-russian separatists grant unrestricted access to the crash site to international experts when it meets at 1900 gmt. canada announced new sanctions against russia and european leaders have signalled they could do likewise as early as tuesday -- barely a week after the last round of toughened embargoes. whole sectors of the economy including goods with possible military uses could be targeted, british prime minister david cameron said. the separatists' violent bid to join russia is the latest chapter in a prolonged crisis sparked by kiev's desire for closer ties with the eu -- a sentiment many in the russian-speaking east do not share."
"asharq-e-df98e9ae230f0f91eaf14dd4eea9a2f1","donetsk, reuters—a train carrying the remains of some of the nearly 300 victims of the malaysia airlines plane downed over ukraine was heading for ukrainian government territory on tuesday as a separatist leader handed over the plane’s black boxes to malaysian experts. dutch prime minister mark rutte told a news conference on monday that the train carrying around 200 body bags was on its way to rebel-held donetsk and then to kharkiv, which is in ukrainian government hands, from where the bodies would be taken back to the netherlands to be identified. the train left the crash site after the malaysian prime minister reached agreement with the separatists for recovered bodies to be handed over to authorities in the netherlands, where the largest number of victims came from. early on tuesday, senior separatist leader aleksander borodai handed over the black boxes in the city of donetsk. “here they are, the black boxes,” borodai told a room packed with journalists at the headquarters of his self-proclaimed donetsk people’s republic as an armed rebel placed the boxes on a desk. colonel mohamed sakri of the malaysian national security council told the meeting the two black boxes were “in good condition.” the handover of the bodies and black boxes, and reports by international investigators of improved access to the wreckage of the airliner four days after it was shot down, occurred against calls for broader sanctions against russia for its support for the rebellion, although western leaders are struggling to agree on a united response. shaken by the deaths of 298 people from across the world, western governments have threatened russia with stiffer penalties for what they say is its backing of pro-russian militia who, their evidence suggests, shot the plane down. at the united nations, the security council unanimously adopted a resolution demanding those responsible “be held to account and that all states cooperate fully with efforts to establish accountability.” it also demanded that armed groups allow “safe, secure, full and unrestricted access” to the crash site. “we owe it to the victims and their families to determine what happened and who was responsible,” said australian foreign minister julie bishop, who traveled to new york to negotiate the un resolution. australia lost 28 citizens in the crash. the kremlin said in a statement late on monday that vladimir putin spoke to dutch prime minister mark rutte on the telephone, with both giving a “high assessment of the resolution passed by the un security council on the investigation into the catastrophe.” meanwhile, european union foreign ministers were scheduled on tuesday to discuss further penalties against russia, but the most they are expected to do is to speed up implementation of sanctions against individuals, and possibly companies, agreed in principle last week before the plane was brought down. western leaders struggled to come to a united response against moscow. france came under pressure on monday from washington and london over plans to deliver a second helicopter carrier to russia. diplomats say more serious sanctions against whole sectors of the russian economy will depend largely on the line taken by the dutch, because of the high number of dutch victims. “it is clear that russia must use her influence on the separatists to improve the situation on the ground,” the dutch prime minister said. “if in the coming days access to the disaster area remains inadequate, then all political, economic and financial options are on the table against those who are directly or indirectly responsible for that,” said rutte. us president barack obama said it was time for russian president vladimir putin and russia “to pivot away from the strategy that they’ve been taking and get serious about trying to resolve hostilities within ukraine.” he said putin and russia had a direct responsibility to compel separatists to cooperate with the investigation, and that the burden was on moscow to insist that separatists stop tampering with the probe, he said. “what are they trying to hide?” obama said at the white house. australian prime minister tony abbott described what was happening at the scene as a cover-up. “after the crime, comes the cover-up. what we have seen is evidence tampering on an industrial scale and obviously that has to stop,” abbott told reporters in canberra on tuesday. russia’s defense ministry has challenged western accusations that pro-russian separatists were responsible for shooting down the airliner and said ukrainian warplanes had flown close to it. the ministry also rejected accusations that russia had supplied the rebels with sa-11 buk anti-aircraft missile systems—the weapon said by kiev and the west to have downed the airliner—”or any other weapons.” putin said in a televised address that the downing of the airliner must not be used for political ends and urged separatists to allow international experts access to the crash site. his ambassador to malaysia said the rebels did not trust the ukrainian government and that was why they did not want to hand over the black boxes to them. “this situation is quite unique, the area is a war zone. i think the international community should be flexible about that and act in a way acceptable to all sides,” lyudmila vorobyeva said in a news conference. european security monitors said gunmen stopped them inspecting the site when they arrived on friday, and ukrainian officials said separatists had tampered with vital evidence. but the spokesman for the european security monitors said they had unfettered access on monday, and three members of a dutch disaster victims identification team arrived at a railway station near the crash site and inspected the storage of the bodies in refrigerated rail cars. peter van vliet, whose team went through the wagons dressed in surgical masks and rubber gloves, said he was impressed by the work the recovery crews had done, given the heat and the scale of the crash site. “i think they did a hell of a job in a hell of a place,” he said. as they went about their work, fighting flared in donetsk, some 40 miles (60 km) from the site, in a reminder of the dangers the experts face operating in a war zone. the government in kiev denied sending the regular army into the center of donetsk, which pro-russian separatists captured in april, but said small “self-organized” pro-ukrainian groups were fighting the rebels in the city. four people were killed in clashes, health officials said. the rebels’ military commander igor strelkov said on his facebook page up to 12 of his men died in monday’s fighting. donetsk is at the heart of a rebel uprising against rule by kiev, and ukrainian president petro poroshenko has vowed to retake the city as part of what kiev calls its “anti-terrorist operation” against the separatists. television images of the rebel-controlled crash site, where the remains of victims had lain decomposing in fields among their personal belongings, have turned initial shock and sorrow after thursday’s disaster into anger."

"jamestown-8bb66979142d5ce966c64e964357d71d","if president vladimir putin really thought that the destruction of flight mh17 with 298 people on board would soon blow over, the white house statement from last friday must have disillusioned him—assuming his subordinates actually informed him about it. the white house statement directly noted: “we have concluded that vladimir putin and the russians are culpable to this tragedy.” russian media did its best to spin these words, whereas the official sources mentioned only the west’s lack of irrefutable evidence ( , july 26). it is possible to interpret “the russians” in this context in the narrow sense—as the separatist rebels—but there is no doubt about the meaning of the point: “… it all goes back ultimately to vladimir putin” ( rbc , july 26). there were at least 15 telephone conversations between putin and western leaders in the immediate aftermath of the air tragedy—though none since last wednesday (july 23). putin had every reason to expect that the unusually moderate tone and content of his address to the russian security council meeting on july 22 would bring a sigh of relief in europe, where many politicians are apprehensive at further aggravating the confrontation between russia and the west ( slon.ru , july 22). many insiders had hinted that the plan to deploy russian “peacekeeping” forces to donetsk and luhansk regions would be on the table, but putin merely confirmed at the security council meeting that russia’s sovereignty was moscow’s top priority and that there were no direct threats to it ( forbes.ru , july 24). the working assumption is that such cautious backpedaling will allow the kremlin to continue exploiting the differences between the united states and key european countries in their varying readiness to punish russia’s barely camouflaged war-making. but such thinking in moscow is based on a complete inability to read the shifts in conflict dynamics ( ezhednevny zhurnal , july 25). the russian proposal to “freeze” the hostilities had initially appeared attractive to many pacifist- and business-minded europeans—but the missile hit on the malaysian boeing 777 has cancelled such an option for good. the european union announced a new package of sanctions against russia on friday. the expansion of the list of “untouchables” had already been agreed to even before the malaysian passenger jet carrying inter alia 80 children, mostly from the netherlands, disappeared from radar screens ( kommersant , july 26). a consensus in brussels has also been reached on a wide range of financial restrictions and trade barriers, which is due to be announced this week ( rbc daily , july 25). many of these measures will negatively affect european businesses, but entrepreneurs have had plenty of time to insure their companies against such losses and are now ready for the coming pain ( nezavisimaya gazeta , july 25). there is hardly any doubt that further sanctions will also be imposed by the us. and russian state-owned and heavily indebted corporations have limited capacity to absorb those. meanwhile, such russian counter measures as slamming fines on mcdonald’s restaurants have no practical consequences ( gazeta.ru , july 25). the russian foreign ministry angrily proclaimed that new sanctions signified the end of security cooperation between russia and the eu. it also furiously rejected washington’s assertions that moscow is ultimately to blame for the downing of flight mh17. but these soviet-style invectives merely confirm that russia is not ready for ostracism (  , july 26). newsru.com russia’s government has no real plan to compensate for the economic impact of western sanctions, and the central bank has again increased the basic interest rate, despite the urgent need to stimulate the stagnating economy ( slon.ru , july 25). the ministry of finance argues for increasing taxes, while the ministry for economic development objects, instead suggesting to spend the currency reserves ( kommersant , july 24). putin has issued some vague instructions to reduce the vulnerability of the economy to external shocks, but has generally shown scant interest in mundane economic matters in the last months ( polit.ru , july 25). moreover, he has stopped trying to check the massive capital flight and to bring back investors ( vedomosti , july 25). putin’s recent visit to cuba seems to have reassured him that authoritarian governments can survive even without delivering economic growth (see edm , july 14). moreover, international sanctions may actually help to explain away russia’s under performance and falling incomes.  kremlin strategists calculate that a bit more sanctions will not make a difference, but the collapse of the externally induced rebellion in eastern ukraine most certainly would. therefore, while assuming a cautious “disengagement” stance, putin has not taken any steps to curtail the inflow of russian arms into the conflict zone. it is becoming more difficult to camouflage this de facto intervention—not only because us intelligence is providing more data on convoys crossing the border, but also because the rebels need more heavy weapons to hold their shrinking ground ( newsru.com , july 24). every day, the ukrainian forces continue their offensive to restore control over new cities in the donetsk and luhansk regions, slowly advancing from the suburbs to the downtowns of both regional centers ( ria novosti , july 27). unless russia escalates its direct military engagement from occasional artillery barrages to moving several battalions into the battlegrounds, the war in eastern ukraine could be extinguished within a few weeks. putin has been maneuvering in this no-win situation, seeking to prolong the hostilities and looking for an opportunity to turn the hopeless separatist cause into a “frozen conflict.” now this maneuvering has come to an inglorious end. new sanctions will not be putting a gentle squeeze on some business interests but rather are designed to produce irreparable disruptions in the russian financial sector and to generate economic havoc and intolerable pain. for putin, this will mean that launching a real intervention is becoming prohibitively risky. in fact, the message inherent in us sanctions on russia are being addressed not to putin, but mostly to the russian elites who have much to lose in the escalating confrontation. the panicky siloviki (security services personnel) may try to stage a palace coup; however, such an attempt is unlikely to include key kremlin insiders like foreign security services (fsb) director alexander bortnikov, foreign intelligence service head mikhail fradkov, former interior minister rashid nurgaliev, security council secretary nikolai patrushev or even rosneft ceo igor sechin, who have themselves been stigmatized by the sanctions regime. a real solution will have to be produced by other elites who realize that the time has come to think hard and fast about a post-putin russia."
